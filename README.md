# User Composition Archive

A re-implementation of the user composition archive for powertabs.

# Planned features

This should be able to perform the following basic tasks:

* Registration of band names
* Uploads and creation of songs (only powertab files)
* Competitions among bands on topics (like the short themed competitions etc. in
  the old UCA).
* Collaborations like the old C-Projects.
